# Pizza Pan App

Our aim

An app designed for restaurant customers to make orders from the browser. Inspired by Domino's Pizza, McDonald's and Just-Eat. The customer is able to browse the menu, submit an order and pay for their food. In the long run, the app will be designed for both sit-in and takeaway use, will be mobile compatible and will contain an animated order update page.

The app is based in React in the front end and Java/Spring in the back end.
